# ip-socket
School project containing simple TCP/UDP socket using Python.

##How to get this program running locally

### With Mac

1. Install Git to your local machine
  * https://git-scm.com/
  * You'll only need commandline tools - the graphical version is not necessary
2. Create a github account
3. Fork this project to your git repository
  * There is the Fork -button at the top of the page
4. Create a directory to your local computer where you want to create the git repository
  * Somewhere you can easily locate via terminal/console, perhaps
5. Pull the project from git to your computer to the directory you just created
  * First, locate to the directory by `$ cd path/to/your/directory`
  * Run `$ git pull YOUR-FORK-REPO-HTTPS-ADDRESS`
  * Get the address from your forked project web page (i.e. press Clone or download -button to find the address)
  * The address should end with `.git`
6. Run the program
  * Should work by running `$ python sandbox.py` in the directory you just forked the project

### With Windows

Should be done pretty much the same way as it works with Mac, with some differences with terminal commands. Specific instructions might be coming up sometime.
